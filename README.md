AP Reader
============

Bootstrap based wordpress JSON reader.

In other words, an HTML & CSS page, created using Bootstrap, that uses javascript/jQuery to read and show content from a wordpress blog that allows to read it using JSON.


This was built for the website artepolitica.com -in spanish-, included in a simple "WebView" android App ("Artepolitica MÃ³vil").
But the html & js code could be usefull for someone trying to play with the wordpress JSON plugin -http://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/- and HTML.
